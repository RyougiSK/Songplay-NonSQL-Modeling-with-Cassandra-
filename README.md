## Project: Songplay data Modeling with Cassandra

### Introduction

A startup called Sparkify wants to analyze the data they've been collecting on songs and user activity on their new music streaming app. The analysis team is particularly interested in understanding what songs users are listening to. Currently, there is no easy way to query the data to generate the results, since the data reside in a directory of CSV files on user activity on the app. Apache Cassandra is considered as the database since the song plays volumn. This project focuses on designing an ETL pipeline to prepare data for the stakeholders.
